 Here is my flask boilerplate for a quick start.
 
 ## Getting started 
 
 ```sh
 virtualenv -p python3 ./env
 source env/bin/activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 python run.py
 ```

 Todo:

 - [ ] handle when there is no application on the dashboard
 - [ ]
## workflow of normal user
add an app
wait for validation
upload files to ftp server
start the application

+ can see the log output of an application
+ improve the admin
